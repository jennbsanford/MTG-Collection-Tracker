# MTG-Collection-Tracker
Track your Magic: the Gathering card collection and decklists!
Keeping track of your physical MTG collection can be quite troublesome, so
so decided to apply software to ease the situation!

# Features!
This program is intended to manage and store data related to your Magic: the Gathering card collection.
Data will be stored on how many copies of a card you own, what cards a deck is included in, and
a decklist management tool which will store your old and current decklists. You can also see what
decks a certain card is related with to help track down that card you can't find anymore!
