# MTG-Collection-Tracker
Track your Magic: the Gathering card collection and decklists!
This project is VERY early in development, and will be lacking essential features.

# Planned Features
This program is intended to manage and store data related to your Magic: the Gathering card collection.
Data will be stored on how many copies of a card you own, what cards a deck is included in, and
a decklist management tool which will store your old and current decklists.
